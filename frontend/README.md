# Micropost - A Distributed Microblogging Service

## Project Overview

This project proposes the design and implementation of MicroPost, a microblogging platform built as a fully distributed system. MicroPost will focus on key distributed system principles such as data replication, fault tolerance, scalability, and concurrency. Users will be able to create posts, follow other users, generate personalized feeds, and interact in real time. The platform will demonstrate essential distributed system features, including handling concurrent user activity, ensuring high availability, and supporting real-time updates with fault-tolerant mechanisms.

## Primary Features

1.  User Account Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
    Microblogging Functionality: Users can post short messages, similar to tweets, and follow other users.
    User Feeds: Each user will have a personalized timeline displaying posts from users they follow.
    Real-time Interactions: Users receive real-time updates for new posts and interactions.
    Search Functionality: Users can search for other users or posts.
    High Availability: Built-in fault tolerance and replication strategies to ensure the system remains operational despite server failures.
    Data Consistency: Ensures data synchronization and eventual consistency across all servers.
